# Welcome to UGeoDB Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to UGeoDB! It means a lot and it will definitely make UGeoDB a better library. 

## Follow the Code of Conduct
All contributors must adhere to the project's code of conduct, which is clearly stated in the repository's [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This includes being respectful to others and avoiding harassment or discrimination.

## Search for existing issues
Before creating a new issue or contributing code, search the repository's issue tracker to see if your problem or suggestion has already been addressed. If it hasn't, create a new issue with a clear title and description.

## Discuss changes
If you're proposing a major change to the project, it's a good idea to discuss it with the maintainers first. This can help ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and that you're not duplicating work.

## Create a fork
Fork the project's repository to create a copy of the project under your own account. This will allow you to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository.

## Create a branch
Create a new branch for your changes to avoid conflicts with other contributors' work. The branch name should be descriptive of the change you're making.

## Make changes and commit
Make changes to the code in your branch and commit them with a clear and concise commit message. Make sure your changes adhere to the project's coding style and conventions. For coding convention, follow [C# Coding Convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

## Create a pull request
When your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the original repository. Describe your changes and why they're important in the PR description, and include any relevant links or screenshots.

## Respond to feedback
The maintainers may request changes or ask for clarification on your PR. Respond to their feedback in a timely manner and make any necessary changes to your code.

## Get your PR merged
Once your PR is approved, the maintainers will merge your changes into the original repository. Congratulations, you've contributed to UGeoDB! ðŸŽ‰
